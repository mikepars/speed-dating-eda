# Speed Dating EDA

## Dataset Information

It’s Valentines Day - a day when people think about love and relationships. How people meet and form relationship works a lot quicker than in our parent’s or grandparent’s day. I’m sure many of you are told how it used to be - you met someone, dated them for a while, proposed, got married. People who grew up in small towns maybe had one shot at finding love, so they made sure they didn’t mess it up.

Today finding a date is not a challenge - finding a match is probably the issue. In the last 20 years we’ve gone from traditional dating to online dating to speed dating to online speed dating. Now you just swipe left or swipe right, if that’s your thing.

In 2002-2004, Columbia University ran a speed-dating experiment where they tracked data over 21 speed dating sessions for mostly young adults meeting people of the opposite sex.

## Objective

Create a problem identification method by using SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and creating an EDA based from the dataset.
